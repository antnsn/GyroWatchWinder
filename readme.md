# ðŸš€ Improved Code for Dual Gyro Watch Winder ðŸš€

This repository holds refined code designed to seamlessly control two stepper motors for the [Dual Gyro Watch Winder 3D project available on Cults3D](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/dual-gyro-winder-watch-winder-remontoir-montre). Experience enhanced functionality and precision!

## ðŸ›  Features ðŸ› 

- **Optimized Motor Functionality:** Enhanced gyroscopic movement for better watch winding.
- **LED Indication:** Blinking LED provides feedback on system state and motor operations.
- **Toggle Button Integration:** Customizable motor operations based on toggle switch states.
- **Automated Run-Pause Cycle:** System runs for 10 minutes, pauses for 50, and resumes, without the need for manual intervention.

## ðŸ“œ Code Overview ðŸ“œ

Built upon the `Stepper.h` and `Timeout.h` libraries, this code offers:
- Dual motor control, catering to individual and combined operations.
- State-driven mechanism, transitioning between "RUN" and "PAUSE" states.
- LED blink feedback throughout system operation.
- Button-driven motor actions, accommodating both single and simultaneous motor rotations.
