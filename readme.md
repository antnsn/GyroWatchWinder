# ðŸš€ Improved Arduino code for Dual Gyrowatch winder from [Cults3D Project](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/dual-gyro-winder-watch-winder-remontoir-montre) ðŸš€

This repository contains a modified code to control stepper motors, tailored specifically for the [3D project available on Cults3D](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/dual-gyro-winder-watch-winder-remontoir-montre). Dive in to see the enhancements!

## ðŸ›  Features ðŸ› 
- **Enhanced Motor Control:** Better responsiveness and precision for motor actions.
- **LED Feedback:** LED blinks indicating motor states and operation modes.
- **Intuitive Button Controls:** Manage different motor actions with ease.
- **Pause Mechanism:** Adds an ability to automatically pause after a certain number of actions.

## ðŸ“œ Code Overview ðŸ“œ
The provided code uses the `Stepper.h` library for motor control. It includes:
- Handling of two different buttons for motor directions.
- LED blinking for feedback.
- Different motor operation modes based on button inputs.
